# Flirtify
Bare-bones Android chat app with a twist: Gemini adds a flirting tone to every message you send!

I made this mostly to have a reason to learn Flutter and Firebase. I don't find it useful enough to publish it anywhere, so you'll have to build from source if you wanna use Flirtify.

## Project setup
- Clone this repo (duh)
- Create a Firebase project and link it to this Flutter app (read Flutter's docs).
- Get a Gemini 1.5 flash API key and place it inside a `.env` file in the project root
  - format: `GEMINI_API=...`
- Attach an Android phone / emulator.
- `flutter run`

## Documentation
All design documents can be found under `docs/`
- Use DrawIO to open `.drawio` files
- Use any browser to open `.svg` files. To edit them, use Inkscape.
